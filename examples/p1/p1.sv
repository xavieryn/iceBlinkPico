/*
p1
This code was grabbed directly from blink and readapted. Looking at the makefile to understand the pcf, I was able to find the variable names 
that were linked to each pin. Using that I went step by step, turning one light on a time, eventually being able to make more and more changes.
I also looked at fade because I originally thought I had to use PWM, so code is heavily inspired from the fade example as well.
